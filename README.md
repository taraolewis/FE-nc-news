DEPLOYED VERSION: The frontend application is hosted on Vercel and can be accessed at: https://fe-nc-news-xi.vercel.app

PROJECT SUMMARY: NC News is a responsive news web application that allows users to browse, read, and interact with a variety of articles on different topics. Built with React, the app connects to the NC News API to provide dynamic content and user interactions in real-time.
